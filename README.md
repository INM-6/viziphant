A Python module for easy visualization of [Neo](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/python-neo) objects and
[Elephant](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/elephant) results.

Viziphant provides a high-level API to easily generate plots and interactive visualizations of neuroscientific data and
analysis results. This API uses and extends the same structure as in Elephant to ensure intuitive usage for scientists
that are used to Elephant.
